[00:00.21] (Too high tonight)
[00:05.74] (Too high tonight)
[00:14.74] 
[00:12.22] Every time I try and run
[00:22.07] Thoughts of you, they make me numb
[00:32.11] Go on, wait, I had too much
[00:41.85] I can't sleep, I'm too fucked up
[00:57.85] 
[00:49.98] I can't see at all
[00:54.73] Am I here alone?
[00:59.69] Is it day or night? (Day or night) Oh
[01:04.15] Got no control, got no control, oh
[01:21.15] 
[01:21.06] Never here, I'm always gone

[01:38.38] I thought I'd feel more alive when it wears off
[01:43.37] But now I think I can die without clothes on
[01:48.49] And if you're not by my side, I can't move on
[01:53.41] Don't ever know
[01:55.50] Don't ever know, 'cause
[02:07.00] 
[01:58.52] I can't see at all
[02:03.39] Am I here alone?
[02:08.16] Is it day or night? Oh
[02:12.12] Got no control, got no control, oh
[02:18.13] I can't see at all
[02:23.05] Am I here alone?
[02:27.81] Is it day or night? Oh
[02:32.21] Got no control, got no control, oh
